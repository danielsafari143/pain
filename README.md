## User Flow

1. **Signup/Login**

   * User registers via phone/email
   * Agrees to *no dating* guideline

2. **Select Contacts**

   * User selects trusted contacts (or adds phone numbers manually)

3. **Set Mood**

   * User taps a mood button
   * Mood stored and synced in realtime

4. **If mood is critical** (Sad/Anxious/Depressed)

   * Push notification sent to selected contacts
   * Contacts receive alert with “Accept Call” button

5. **Contact accepts**

   * Voice call established (Twilio/Agora)
   * No chat, no profile browsing, just call

6. **After call ends**

   * Both sides get a short feedback form
   * Option to report misuse

## Basic Database Structure (Firebase Realtime DB)

```json
{
  "users": {
    "userId1": {
      "name": "Alice",
      "phone": "+243xxxxxx",
      "contacts": ["userId2", "userId3"],
      "currentMood": "Sad",
      "moodNote": "Feeling overwhelmed at work"
    },
    "userId2": {
      ...
    }
  },
  "calls": {
    "callId1": {
      "caller": "userId1",
      "listener": "userId2",
      "startTime": 1685000000,
      "endTime": 1685000300,
      "feedback": {
        "caller": "positive",
        "listener": "positive"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

---

## API & Cloud Functions Needed

* **SetMood(userId, mood, note)**: Updates user mood in DB
* **NotifyContacts(userId)**: Sends notifications to contacts if mood is critical
* **AcceptCall(callerId, listenerId)**: Establish call session, mark listener as busy
* **EndCall(callId, feedbackCaller, feedbackListener)**: Save call metadata & feedback
* **ReportUser(reportedUserId, reporterUserId, reason)**: Flag for moderation

---

## UI Screens (Very Minimal)

1. **Login / Signup**
2. **Select Trusted Contacts**
3. **Mood Selection** (buttons with icons + optional note)
4. **Contacts List with Mood Status** (shows contacts' latest moods)
5. **Incoming Call Screen** (Accept/Decline call)
6. **In-Call Screen** (Hang up button)
7. **Post-Call Feedback**

---

## Timeline (24h)

| Time   | Task                                                                  |
| ------ | --------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 0–3h   | Setup Firebase, Twilio/Agora accounts, basic auth + DB schema         |
| 3–7h   | Build Login, Signup & Contacts selection screens + logic              |
| 7–10h  | Build Mood buttons screen + Realtime DB update + notifications        |
| 10–14h | Integrate Twilio/Agora voice call flow + Incoming/Active call screens |
| 14–18h | Post-call feedback + abuse reporting + community guidelines UI        |
| 18–22h | Polish UI, test flows, fix bugs                                       |
| 22–24h | Final testing & deployment                                            |
